# No Automatic Building or Testing

Do NOT automatically build, compile, or test code changes unless explicitly requested by the user.

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't run `xcodebuild`, `npm test`, `cargo build`, etc. after making changes
- ❌ Don't run build scripts automatically
- ❌ Don't run test suites to verify changes
- ❌ Don't attempt to compile or validate code execution

## What to Do Instead

- ✅ Make the requested code changes
- ✅ Check for linter errors with ReadLints if appropriate
- ✅ Explain what was changed and why
- ✅ Let the user decide when to build/test

## When Building IS Allowed

Only run build or test commands when:
1. The user explicitly asks you to build/compile
2. The user explicitly asks you to run tests
3. The user asks you to verify the code works

## Example

```markdown
User: "Add a new feature X"
Assistant: *makes code changes* ✅
Assistant: *does NOT run build* ✅
Assistant: "I've added feature X by modifying files A and B. You can build and test when ready."

User: "Build and run the app to test it"
Assistant: *now runs build command* ✅
```
